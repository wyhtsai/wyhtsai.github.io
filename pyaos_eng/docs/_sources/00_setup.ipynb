    "\n",
    "1. **Generate an SSH Key Pair:**  \n",
    "   Open a terminal on your **local machine** and run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair:\n",

    "   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "When prompted, you can press Enter to accept the default file location and leave the passphrase blank for convenience. This will create a private and a public key in the `~/.ssh` directory.\n",

    "1. **Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server:**  \n",
    "   Use the ssh-copy-id command to copy your public key to the remote server: (also execute on the **local machine**)\n",
